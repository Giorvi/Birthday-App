This app takes the input the user types into the text box and returns one of two things. How old the user is, a countdown to their next birthday and their astrological sign all based on the information the user typed. The app has a check format function that checks if the user's input is in mm/dd/yyyy format. If the input is not in that format the app returns "Sorry, but you did not enter a date in the correct format of mm/dd/yyyy." The app is styled in the HTML file using a style tag. the background is purple and grey and the font is Papyrus.
